Hi, I’m Berk—a researcher with a passion for optimizing real-world operations. Recently, I’ve been focused on multi-channel operations and exploring how emerging tech can drive meaningful impact. My work spans theoretical modeling, deep dives into data, and developing algorithms. I also have a special interest in quantum computing. I enjoy the challenge of transforming complex ideas into practical solutions.

Outside of work, I enjoy art house films and love sharing my takes on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/berkolmez/). You might also find me biking around the city or on a run, discovering new paths. If that’s your thing too, feel free to follow me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/144034223)!
