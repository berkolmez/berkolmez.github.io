abstract = {Healthcare services can be offered both in-person and virtually by the same providers. We study a clinic's decision of whether to pool the resources of both channels or to have dedicated resources for each channel, where patients decide which channel to join (or whether to balk) while observing the expected waiting time for both channels and the distance to the in-person facility. Contrary to the consensus in the classical pooling literature, our findings indicate that patients’ expected waiting times and net utilities do not necessarily improve with pooling. We highlight that pooling the two channels yields benefits for the providers only when the net profit generated from the virtual channel is substantially similar to that of the physical channel.}

author = {Omer Berk Olmez and Alex Mills},
journal = {Working paper},
year = {2024},
abstract = {As the digital landscape continues to shape customer expectations, understanding the value customers place on virtual and in-person services has become increasingly important. This study leverages data from the undergraduate academic advisement operation at a public university in New York to explore the impact of service delivery channels on customer choices. By employing econometric models, we examine the influence of appointment attributes, such as delivery channel, date, time, duration, and distance, on customer preferences. The study addresses four key research questions: (1) How do customers value virtual appointments compared to in-person appointments? (2) Which appointment attributes have the most significant impact on customer decisions? (3) Are there demographic differences in the utilization of virtual and in-person services? (4) What factors contribute to appointment no-shows or cancellations? The findings of this research have implications for healthcare operations, as the popularity of telehealth and virtual appointments has grown.}

abstract = {Households produce large amounts of waste cooking oil (WCO), which should be disposed properly to avoid its negative impacts on the environment. Using WCO as raw material in biodiesel production is an effective disposal method. In this study, we focus on designing an efficient WCO collection network, in which households deposit their WCO into the bins to be placed at several collection centers (CCs), which are then regularly collected by capacitated vehicles. We study the problem of determining (i) the number and location of the CCs, (ii) the assignment of households to the CCs, respecting a certain coverage distance threshold, (iii) the number of bins to place at each CC, and (iv) the vehicle routes navigating between the biodiesel facility and CCs to minimize the sum of fixed cost of opening CCs and placing bins at each CC and routing cost. To solve the proposed location-routing problem, we develop a novel matheuristic based on Variable Neighborhood Search, which incorporates an integer programming model to determine the bin allocation and assignment decisions. We evaluate the solution performance of different variants of the proposed algorithm by performing an extensive computational study on a set of hypothetical and case instances. The results show that the proposed matheuristic provides superior solutions with respect to benchmark algorithms.}
